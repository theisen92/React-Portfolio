                I completed the Full Stack Developer program at University of
                Minnesota. I am currently working at Alarm.com as a Support
                Operations Associate. In my current roll I work with security
                professionals over the phone to find creative solutions to
                complex issues and situations.

                Before my current job I lived in the Philippines fo 2 years
                helping out a non-profit starting up a screen printing and
                sewing shop. During that time I also worked with LSJ collective
                working as a marketing strategist. I would edit and create
                videos and visual content using Adobe photoshop, premiere pro
                and after effects. Before starting both of those positions I
                didnâ€™t have any experience with Adobe or working textiles. I had
                to learn on the job which was my favorite part about those
                positions. I am looking for a job that pushes me and helps me
                grow and learn more about this exciting field.
